# Development Session Summary â€” 2024-07-16

## Overview
This session focused on building and organizing the core of the `financial_data_collector` module for the modular AI trading platform. The workflow included design review, scaffolding, implementation, validation, and version control.

---

## Key Decisions & Actions
- **Monorepo Structure:** Confirmed a clean, flat `services/` directory for all microservices (no nested `services/services/`).
- **Module Split:** Separated Yahoo/FRED/ABS and Alpaca ingestion into independent Poetry-managed microservices to avoid dependency conflicts.
- **Scaffolding:** Created all required folders and files for `financial_data_collector` and `alpaca_data_collector`.
- **Config & Schema:** Added YAML config templates and JSON schema files for all data types.
- **Ingestion Scripts:** Implemented and tested scripts for OHLCV, macro, fundamentals, and events (with ETF handling).
- **Schema Validation:** Added and tested `jsonschema` validation for OHLCV and macro scripts.
- **GitHub:** Initialized git, made the first commit, and pushed the project to GitHub.

## Progress Checklist (as of this session)
- [x] Design docs and planning complete
- [x] Project and module scaffolding
- [x] All configs and schemas in place
- [x] OHLCV, macro, fundamentals, and events ingestion scripts implemented and tested
- [x] Schema validation for OHLCV and macro scripts
- [x] Folder structure confirmed clean
- [x] Project committed and pushed to GitHub

## Next Steps
- [ ] Add schema validation to fundamentals and events scripts
- [ ] Add logging and error handling to all scripts
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests
- [ ] Document usage and example runs in README
- [ ] (Optional) Add Dockerfile logic and Prometheus metrics

**For next time:**
- Pick up with schema validation for the remaining scripts, then proceed with logging and testing.
- Continue to use the checklist in `Module_1_Development_Checklist.md` to track progress.
