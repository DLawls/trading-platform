### ‚ôªÔ∏è Next Steps

1. Break each section into its own `*.md` spec file.
2. Start prototyping **one module** (suggestion: Financial Data Collector or ModelOps pipeline).
3. Define shared schema and interfaces (e.g. JSON for data passing).
4. Explore monetization paths (CLI tools, APIs, SaaS dashboards, plugins).
