# Development Environment for a Modular AI Trading System

## Repository Layout (Monorepo vs. Multi-Repo)  
A **monorepo** can consolidate all microservice codebases into one repository, making it easier to share common libraries, enforce uniform tooling (linters, CI/CD, etc.), and implement atomic changes across services. For tightly integrated components (e.g. shared data models or utilities), this simplifies dependency management and cross-service testing. In contrast, a **multi-repo** (one repo per service) provides stronger isolation, autonomy, and access controls – useful if teams work independently or have differing release schedules. For example, separate repos reduce blast radius and allow per-service CI/CD pipelines. In most cases of a single-team AI platform, a **monorepo with well-structured subdirectories** (one per microservice) is recommended: it centralizes code and CI and eases onboarding. If security or scaling concerns prevail (many independent teams or huge codebase), justify splitting into a few repos by service or function.  

## Docker Setup (Development vs Production)  
Use **Docker Compose** for local development and lightweight orchestration. In development, mount code directories as volumes so containers auto-reload on changes (e.g. Python’s Flask/Gunicorn or FastAPI with auto-reload). Define a `docker-compose.yml` that spins up all service containers, along with dependencies like databases or message brokers.

For production, use **multi-stage Dockerfiles** to build lean images: in the first stage install build tools (e.g. C/C++ compilers, pip, etc.) and compile time-sensitive C++ modules; in the final stage copy only the runtime artifacts (Python code, compiled binaries) into a minimal base image. This yields smaller, secure images (build tools are omitted in the final stage). Always choose slim official images (e.g. `python:3.X-slim`) and use a `.dockerignore` file. Tag and version each service’s image. Optionally, use separate Compose files or profiles for **dev vs prod**: e.g. `docker-compose.override.yml` for dev with ports and mounts, and `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production settings (no volumes, optimized configs). In production, orchestrate these Docker images via Kubernetes or Docker Swarm if needed, but even a Docker Compose “stack” can suffice for initial deployment.

## Inter-Service Communication and Data Flow  
Design services to communicate through well-defined APIs or messaging. For **synchronous** calls (request/response), use lightweight protocols: e.g. RESTful HTTP/JSON is simple and language-agnostic, while **gRPC** (ProtoBuf-based) can provide higher throughput and smaller payloads for performance-critical calls.

Use gRPC for high-speed RPC between services (e.g. order matching to price service), and REST/JSON for user-facing or less-frequent interactions.

For **asynchronous** data flow (streaming market data, event passing, work queues), use message queues or streaming platforms: for example **Kafka** is ideal for high-throughput event streaming (market ticks, trade events), while **RabbitMQ** or **Redis Pub/Sub** might suffice for lighter message queuing.

In practice, combine methods: e.g. publish price updates on a Kafka topic consumed by downstream ML or signal services, and have services call each other via REST/gRPC when needing immediate data.

## Environment and Dependency Management  
Use dedicated environment tools per language. For Python, adopt **Poetry** to manage dependencies and virtual environments: Poetry automatically creates an isolated venv for each project and centralizes dependency specs in `pyproject.toml`. This ensures reproducible environments and keeps the global Python interpreter clean.

Store Python version in `.python-version` and use **pyenv** on each dev machine (and in Docker) to switch interpreters. For C++ components, use **Conan** as the package manager to declare and fetch libraries (e.g. Eigen, Boost). Write a `conanfile.txt` or `conanfile.py` specifying C++ deps and build requirements; this ensures consistent C++ builds across machines and can cache precompiled binaries.

In Docker builds, invoke Conan in the build stage to install needed C++ libs before compiling. Pin exact versions for all dependencies (via Poetry/Conan lock files) and include them in CI.

Use a single repo “monorepo” layout with a root directory containing subfolders (e.g. `services/ai_engine/`, `services/data_feed/`, etc.), each with its own Poetry environment or `requirements.txt` and C++ build instructions.

## ML Experimentation and Pipeline Tools  
Integrate modern MLOps tools to support your data science workflow.

For **experiment tracking and model registry**, use a tool like **MLflow** or **Weights & Biases (W&B)**. MLflow is open-source and can be self-hosted: it offers experiment tracking, model versioning, and a model registry, letting teams log metrics and compare runs. W&B provides similar functionality with a polished UI: it lets teams track experiments, version datasets, visualize results, and collaborate on model iterations. Using either tool, ensure every training run logs parameters, metrics, and artifacts.

For **data and model versioning**, use **DVC (Data Version Control)**: DVC lets you capture versions of large datasets and models in Git-like fashion, storing actual data in cloud storage or local cache. This creates a single provenance record of data, code, and model together. It supports pipelines too: you can define DVC stages to preprocess data, train models, etc., and reproduce results. Optionally integrate **CML (Continuous Machine Learning)** in CI to automate training from your repo/DVC.

For feature engineering or pipeline experimentation, tools like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **scikit-learn** (for classical features), and ML libraries like **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow** will be used inside these pipelines.

## Orchestration and Monitoring  
Use workflow orchestrators to schedule data/ML pipelines, and monitoring stacks to observe system health.

For **workflow orchestration**, consider **Apache Airflow** or **Prefect**. Airflow is a mature platform for authoring and scheduling batch-oriented data workflows using Python-defined DAGs. Prefect is a newer, Pythonic orchestration framework designed for reliability and dynamic workflows; it can orchestrate "microservices-like" data pipelines and integrates well with cloud deployment. Choose based on team preference: Prefect often requires less boilerplate, while Airflow has a large community. Use these tools to codify end-to-end ML/data pipelines (e.g. nightly model training, data refresh jobs) with retries, monitoring, and logging.

For **monitoring and metrics**, set up **Prometheus + Grafana**. Prometheus is an open-source monitoring toolkit that scrapes time-series metrics from your services and stores them for querying. It works well in microservice architectures (pull-model HTTP scraping). Instrument each service to expose relevant metrics (request rates, latencies, hardware/memory usage). Grafana can then visualize these Prometheus metrics as dashboards. For example, graph service latencies, error rates, or custom business KPIs. Also use Prometheus Alertmanager to define alerts (e.g. if error rate spikes). Together, this stack provides real-time visibility. For logs, consider a centralized logging solution (ELK stack or Loki) to aggregate service logs.

## C++ and Python Integration  
For performance-critical modules, implement them in C++ and expose them to Python. Use **pybind11** to bind C++ code into Python modules. Pybind11 is a lightweight, header-only library that greatly simplifies creating Python bindings for C++ functions and classes.

In practice, write your C++ library (e.g. in a `cpp/` subdir) and use `PYBIND11_MODULE` macros to define the interface to Python. You can build the C++ code as a Python extension (via CMake or a `setup.py`/`pyproject.toml` build script invoking `pybind11.get_include()`) so that Python imports it like a native module.

This lets Python services call the C++ module for time-critical loops (e.g. rapid signal computation) while maintaining Python-level orchestration. In Docker builds, compile the C++ code in the build stage and ensure the resulting `.so` (or `.pyd`) is included in the final image. Use Conan to fetch any C++ dependencies before building. This approach yields high-performance code in C++ accessible from Python.

## WSL2 and Windows File System Tips  
Under Windows 11/WSL2, place your project code on the **WSL (ext4) file system**, not the Windows NTFS drives. Cross-OS mounts (like editing code on `C:\` from WSL) can be extremely slow. Instead, keep the git repo inside your Ubuntu home (e.g. `~/projects/trading-platform`) or on a WSL-mounted VHDX.

Microsoft documentation and community advice emphasize that moving files into WSL eliminates the cross-OS filesystem latency. You can create a symbolic link on Windows (e.g. `C:\Repos`) to point to the WSL directory, letting Windows tools access the files without performance loss. In VS Code, use the “Remote - WSL” extension to edit code directly in WSL. Also, allocate sufficient resources to WSL2 (memory/CPU) and keep Docker Desktop set to use the WSL2 backend. By following these guidelines, file I/O (git, builds, Docker mounting) will be fast and reliable on WSL2.
